                <p>Hi! I'm Jack, and I'm a MCDB graduate from the University of Michigan. 
                    My passion for the subject began in high school where I stumbled upon a couple of biology books which blew my mind. This passion led me to compete in the British Biology olympiad, 
                    where I won a Gold. <br>
                    Since then, I've continued pursuing biology in Michigan, where I've had the pleasure to explore a wide range of classes such as biochemistry, genetics, 
                    and even a graduate class in immunology.
                    AT university, I have also thorougly delved into research in many areas, and have since narrowed my focus on structural biology. 
                    I am captivated by uncovering the mysterious relationship between the structure of macromolecules and their function, 
                    as well as the freedom to exercise creativity in manipulating them for our benefit.
                    I currently work as a tech at the Mosalaganti lab, where I work on various structure related projects.
                    In the future, I intend to pursue graduate school, where I can continue deepening my understanding of structural biology. </p>
                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>Outside of lab, I enjoy a lot of activities, including art, gaming, rock climbing, Taekwondo, and cooking! Here are a couple examples of my work:</p>
